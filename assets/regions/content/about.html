    <div>As a privately contracted educator we noticed an opportunity in the area of specialized
        learning as a traditional learning and teaching experience has not sustained the pace of
        societal and cultural evolution. With persons seeking assistance they usually must do the 
        majority of the work themselves.  Tasks such as;
        <ol>
            <li>Find the name of the best known teacher</li>
            <li>Learn of their most recent schedule</li>
            <li>Acquire a contact number</li>
            <li>Designate a location to conduct the session</li>
            <li>Arrange for a mutually advantageous date &amp; time</li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
        These additional tasks make the process of hiring an individual incredibly exhausting. There is
        too much inefficiency in the entire process. The solution is an online marketplace designed
        to make the initial contact, and service delivery more efficient for those seeking assistance
        in any capacity. By providing an alternative to physical queues, customer satisfaction is 
        maintained over time.

    <span>Athlene Learning offers private tutelage to those who are frustrated 
        with the inadequacies of traditional teaching. Too often lessons' class 
        sizes can be too big and the well meaning instructor is unable to provide 
        the one on one instruction or remediation that the student desperately needs.

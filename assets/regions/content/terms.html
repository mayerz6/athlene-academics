<h1>Terms of Service</h1>


We’re Barbados’ BEST individualised learning institution providing specifically designed tutelage within an engaging yet non-traditional classroom environment.  Each course is taught by an expert instructor, and every course is available on-demand, so students can learn at their own pace, on their own time, and on any device. 

A personalized learning resource for all ages 

ATHLENE ACADEMICS offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps.  

Free tools for parents and teachers 

We’re working hard to ensure that ATHLENE ACADEMICS empowers coaches of all kinds to better understand what their children or students are up to and how best to help them. See at a glance whether a child or student is struggling or if she hit a streak and is now far ahead of the class. Our coach dashboard provides a summary of class performance as a whole as well as detailed student profiles. 

Our Mission 

Our mission is to bring accessible, affordable, engaging, and highly effective higher education to the world. We believe that higher education is a basic human right, and we seek to empower our students to advance their education and careers. 

Education is no longer a one-time event but a lifelong experience. Education should be less passive listening (no long lectures) and more active doing. Education should empower students to succeed not just in school but in life. 

 

Our Story 

ATHLENE ACADEMICS was born out of a need.  A need to help strengthen the academic skills of children within a neighbourhood.  The solution through ATHLENE ACADEMICS was devised, experimented and implemented by Mrs. Ingrid Corbin; who has subsequently offered assistance in the subjects of English Literature and Language to anyone with a will to see their children succeed. Over five (5) years and 100 students later; ATHLENE ACADEMICS was born. Now we're a growing team of educators and engineers on a mission to change the future of education by bridging the gap between real-world skills, relevant education, and employment.

Purchase, Payment, Recurring Monthly

Billing When you select an online tutoring plan, we immediately charge your credit card and put into your account the number of minutes that correspond to your online tutoring plan. On the same day of each month, until you tell us otherwise, we charge your monthly fee to your credit card and refill your account with the number of minutes that correspond to your online tutoring plan. When you finish a tutoring session, we deduct the time you spent with the tutor from your account balance.

Please note that in months with fewer than 31 days, we charge your card on the last day of the month if your numerical billing date does not occur. (For example, if you sign up for an online tutoring plan on January 31, we would bill your card again on February 28. In future months, we would continue billing your card on the 28th.)

The minutes we place in your account each month remain in your account until you use them in a session with one of our tutors, or until you cancel your online tutoring plan. Any used minutes from one month to the next will be removed. If you cancel your online tutoring plan, we remove your unused minutes from your account at what would have been your next billing date.

While enrolled in an online tutoring plan, you may also purchase single hours at a fixed rate without upgrading or downgrading your plan, or changing your billing date. If you choose to purchase a single hour, we immediately charge your credit card and add 60 minutes to your account.

General Behavior at Community forum
In addition to the terms, related to prohibited activities and content permissibility, applicable on a User of the Website TutorEye, we have outlined guidelines for General behavior, which every Community User must obey. At TutorEye Community, we expect discussion to be courteous even when disagreement may be vigorous. When writing your messages, please use the same courtesy that you would show when speaking face to face with someone. Flames, insults, and personal attacks will not be tolerated. It's fine to disagree with opinions, ideas, and facts, but always with respect for the other person. Also, note that messages express the thoughts of the writers, not the Community, its Owners/Admins, Experts, or Community Reps. Visitors who post discourteous messages will be warned and repeated violation of the rules will cause the removal of such User from the Platform.

We have the sole authority to remove any post, which we believe does not meet our general behavior guidelines.

Posts are editable for a brief period following posting to allow correction of spelling errors, formatting, etc. After that, members may not edit their own posts. This prevents one member from editing an earlier post in a thread, rendering comments by others irrelevant or seemingly inaccurate. Similarly, we cannot delete posts upon request. Doing so would destroy the integrity of our archive and consume a huge amount of manpower. Therefore, please do not post personal data or other information that could prove to be a problem later.

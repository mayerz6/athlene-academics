                        <span>ATHLENE was born out of a need.  A need to help strengthen the academic skills of 
                            children within a neighbourhood.  The solution through ATHLENE was devised, experimented 
                            and implemented by Mrs. Ingrid Corbin; who has subsequently offered assistance in the 
                            subjects of English Literature and Language to anyone with a will to see their children 
                            succeed. Over five (5) years and 100 students later; ATHLENE was born. Now we're a growing 
                            team of educators and engineers on a mission to change the future of education by 
                            bridging the gap between real-world skills, relevant education, and employment. </span>

                    <div>As a privately contracted educator we noticed an opportunity in the area of specialized
                        learning as a traditional learning and teaching experience has not sustained the pace of
                        societal and cultural evolution. With persons seeking assistance they usually must do the 
                        majority of the work themselves.  Tasks such as;
                        <ol>
                            <li>Find the name of the best known teacher</li>
                            <li>Learn of their most recent schedule</li>
                            <li>Acquire a contact number</li>
                            <li>Designate a location to conduct the session</li>
                            <li>Arrange for a mutually advantageous date &amp; time</li>
                        </ol>
                        <hr>
                        These additional tasks make the process of hiring an individual incredibly exhausting. There is
                        too much inefficiency in the entire process. The solution is an online marketplace designed
                        to make the initial contact, and service delivery more efficient for those seeking assistance
                        in any capacity. By providing an alternative to physical queues, customer satisfaction is 
                        maintained over time.

                    <span>Athlene offers private tutelage to those who are frustrated 
                        with the inadequacies of traditional teaching. Too often lessons' class 
                        sizes can be too big and the well meaning instructor is unable to provide 
                        the one on one instruction or remediation that the student desperately needs.
